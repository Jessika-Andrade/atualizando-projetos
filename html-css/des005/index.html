            Synopsis
        </h3>
        <p>
            This book is a compilation of small observations and musings. It's filled with moments of reflection and a love letter to simple joys: passing a simple blade of grass on the sidewalk, the freedom of peeing outdoors late at night, or the way a hand-built ceramic mug feels when it's full of warm tea on a chilly morning. It's a catalog and a compendium that examines the complicated experience of being all too human and interacting with a complex, confounding, breathtaking world... and a reminder to stop and be awake and alive in yourself.

            These Days (Poem)
        </h3>
        <p class="poem">
            I've been doing this funny thing in the afternoons,<br>
            This going and lying down<br>
            In our bed thing,<br>
            Slightly curled on my side<br>
            In my jeans and shoes,<br>
            Staring at the back side of the blinds,<br>
            Crying.
        </p>
        <p class="poem">
            My puffed cheek soaks our pillow<br>
            And I cry.<br>
            No known reason-<br>
            Just tears on my side,<br>
            Slightly fetal,<br>
            Hidden,<br>
            Sad to my bones.
        </p>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p title="That's how you know more about me!">
            Instead of seeing them as separate activities, I think of reading, watching movies, and binging TV shows as a single, multi-faceted hobby centered around storytelling. There is a certain magic to getting lost in a good book, where the words on the page conjure up entire worlds, and an equally captivating experience in seeing a story brought to life on the big screen or through a well-crafted television series. One moment, I might be diving into the rich details of a novel, and the next, I'm analyzing the director's choices in its film adaptation, appreciating the unique strengths each medium brings. There’s a distinct, irreplaceable pleasure that comes from the communal experience of going to the cinema, the lights dimming and the shared silence before a story begins. It’s all part of the same passion for narrative, a continuous journey across different formats and worlds.
